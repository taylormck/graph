CS 378 Project 5 - Graph
===========
Reverse engineer the Boost Graph Library adjacency list implementation of a graph.  
The graph will be directed, sparse, unweighted, possibly connected, and possibly cyclic.


Description
-----------
View the [project page](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs378/drupal/graph).  
For all projects, the minimum requirement for getting a non-zero grade is to write
standard-compliant C++ and to satisfy all of the requirements in the table below,
including the precise naming of all the files.  
For this project, the additional minium requirement for getting a non-zero grade is
that you use Google Test instead of CppUnit.  
You can earn 5 bonus pts, if you work with a partner using pair programming and vouch
for the fact that you worked on the project together for more than 75% of the time.
Bonus pts will not increase the total score beyond the max score.  
Only one solution must be turned in for the pair. If two solutions are turned in,
there will be a 10% penalty, and the later one will be graded.  
You may not use new, delete, malloc() or free().  
You may use the STL. You may not use boost::graph<T, A>!
